## Grammar

The grammar is simple and there are no exceptions\*.

\*: with the only exception from the "no exception" rule being the letter `y`.

### Alphabet and pronunciation

The alphabet has 12 letters, consisting of 3 vowels, 2 semi-vowels and 7 consonants.

Semi-vowels are considered as their own group, they cannot be substitutes of consonants or vowels!

The alphabet is `k, l, m, n, p, s, t, a, i, o, w, y`.

The sound of each letter is the same as their sound in IPA, with the only exception being the letter `y`, which denotes the `/j/` sound.

Nothing is capitalized by default, although the first word of a sentence can be capitalized, if it would take effort to make it not so (e.g. when typing on phone).

Transliterated/foreign/loanwords are always capitalized.

### Word structure

Words are made out of CVs (consonant, vowel, optional semivowel) consonants, where `C = {k, l, m, n, p, s, t}; V = {a, i, o}; s = {w, y}`.

Compound words are hyphenated and for all intents and purposes are a single word. Two or more nouns, verb and modifiers can be combined into compound words, but you cannot combine words of different part of speech! An example for a compound word is _ko-si_, which means "communication system" or "system of communication".

### Word order

The basic sentence structure is SVO (subject-verb-object), where the subject is always noun phrases, the predicate is always a verb phrase and an object is always a prepositional phrase.

Phrases are head-final (the modifiers precede the head). Adjective phrases do not exist.

Conjunctions are used to connect two phrases or sentences together. Joined sentences are separated by a comma.

Prepositions are followed by noun phrases and are located at the end of sentences.

### Numbers



### Names

Names must be valid words according to previous rules. The name order follows the Eastern name order, meaning that the surname preceded the given name(s).

#### Transliterating into Picilang

- Standard rules apply, including the name order.
- Consonant and vowel clusters has to be broken down.
- The syllable count must remain the same.
- When a word begins with a vowel, the transliterated word's first consonant should be used in place of the missing vowel, or the removed consonant, if it had a consonant cluster.
- Transliterated names always begin with a capital letter.
- Initials in names should become a single syllable.
- Use semi-vowels as they feel right, but keep in mind, that they cannot be used as consonants!
  - However, they can be used in place of consonants
- Names and titles can be merged into one word when transliterated and this "work around" some of the restrictions.
- For deciding what letter to you for sounds that aren't present in Picilang, you can use the following _professional_ tables:

These categories are only a recommendation that makes sense to me, not an official rule.

Examples:

- Internet &gt; Nitini
- Github &gt; Kito
- B. Zoltan Gorza &gt; Kosa Pi Sota, Kosapisota
- n√©vtelen &gt; Niwtilin
- Anon &gt; Nano
- Mass Effect &gt; Masipi, Ma Pipi
- Linux &gt; Lino
- Audacity &gt; Tawtasiti
