The grammar is simple and there are (almost) no exceptions\*.

\*: with the only exceptions from the "no exception" rule being the way numbers are formed.

## Alphabet and pronunciation <a id="abc" href="#top">¤</a>

The alphabet has 12 letters, consisting of 3 vowels, 2 semi-vowels and 7 consonants.

Semi-vowels are considered as their own group, they cannot be substitutes of consonants or vowels!

The alphabet is `k, l, m, n, p, s, t, a, i, o, w, j`.

The sound of each letter is the same as their sound in IPA.

Nothing is capitalized by default, although the first word of a sentence can be capitalized, if it would take effort to make it not so (e.g. when typing on phone).

Transliterated/foreign/loanwords are always capitalized.

The stress is on either the first syllable or, in case of compound words, on the first syllable of the root word which you want to emphasize. To visually represent stress or emphasis, you can use an acute accent on the stressed syllable's vowel  (`a => á, i => í, o => ó`).

## Word structure

Words are made out of CVs (consonant, vowel, optional semivowel) consonants, where `C = {k, l, m, n, p, s, t}; V = {a, i, o}; s = {w, y}`.

### Compound words

Compound words are hyphenated and for all intents and purposes are a single word. Two or more words of the same part of speech can be combined into compound words, but you cannot combine words of different part of speech! An example for a compound word is _ko-si_, which means "communication system" or "system of communication".

The "main", "more significant" or "broader" root word should be the last one and "specifying" roots precede them, for example in _ko-si_, "si" means "system" and "ko" means "communication".  
However, it is customary to place `naj`, `ma` and `lo` at the end of compound words, ta Kosapisota kiwti la.

## Parts of speech

Picilang has 5 parts of speech, _nouns, verbs, modifiers, conjunctions and prepositions_.

Most of these work mostly like in English and many other languages, but _modifiers_ can be parts either noun or verb phrases, so there are no separate adjectives and adverbs.

## Word order

The basic sentence structure is SVO (subject-verb-object), where the subject and object are always noun phrases, the predicate is always a verb phrase.  
Because the objects has to be noun phrases, sentences like "noun is adjective" are structured like "adjective noun is", e.g. _It is two._ would be _to na sa_ (literary "two it is").

Phrases are head-final (the modifiers precede the head). Modifier phrases are impossible.

Conjunctions are used to connect two phrases or sentences together. Joined sentences are separated by a comma.  
When multiple phrases are joined by conjunctions, the conjunction has to be said every time (e.g. `ni ko ti ko na`, not `ni, ti ko na`).

Prepositions are followed by noun phrases and are located at the end of sentences, and a comma may be used to separate them from the rest of the sentence.

## Sentence types

Regardless of its type, a sentence always have at least a subject and a verb, and use SVO word order.

Incomplete sentences are not allowed.

### Declarative sentences

Declarative sentences are the _default_, there is nothing special about them.

### Interrogative sentences

Interrogative sentences, also knows as "questions", has three types that have different sentence structures. They all end with a question mark. These types and their structures are:

- **General or yes-no questions**: it has the same structure as declarative sentences
- **Special or kiw- questions**: these are the equivalent of English's _wh- questions_ and they contain one or more _question words_
- **Multiple choice questions**: somewhere in the sentence multiple choices are presented that are separated by `tajtaj` or `tajkotaj`; the former allows only one of the options to be correct, while the latter allows multiple choices (in other words, they work similarly to exclusive and inclusive or respectively)

The **question words** are `kiwno`, `kiwto`, `kiwmo`, `kiwko` and `kiwpi`, that ask about which and are used in place of a noun, verb, modifier, conjunction or preposition respectively.  
For certain questions (such as "why") a combination of a preposition or noun, and `kiwno` is used, such as `ta kiwno` means "why" and `nomi kiwmo` for "how many".

Answers can be formed multiple ways, depending on what kind of question was used. The possible formats are the following:

- "Yes" and "no"
  - using the words `lo` and `naj` either as verbs (meaning "yes" or "replying yes", and "no" or "replying no" respectively), usually with the subject `li` (used as a general "placeholder" noun), `la` (this noun explicitly refers back to the question's subject or object, depending on context), `ni`, `ti` or `na` (these are the 1st, 2nd and 3rd person pronouns respectively)
  - using the word `naj` as a modifier before the question's object in a noun phrase, followed by `sa` (meaning "not object")
  - using the word `naj` as a modifier before the question's subject, followed by the question's verb (meaning "no")
  - repeating the question's subject and object
- kiw- answers follow the format _kiw sa X_, where X is the whole questioned phrase. All answers are considered nouns for the purpose of simplicity
  - In case of `kiwno`, the object is simply a noun (e.g. _kiw sa li_).
  - ~ `kiwto`, the object is a verb.
  - ~ `kiwmo`, the object is the questioned modifier followed by the noun from the question.
  - ~ `kiwko`, the object is the questioned conjunction surrounded by both phrases (with or without all of their modifiers, e.g. _kiw sa ni ko ti_ and _kiw sa mipi li taj na_).
  - ~ `kiwpi`, there is no object, but there is a full prepositional phrase at the end of the sentence (e.g. _kiw sa sipi ma_)
- choice questions are answered by repeating the choice (or choices separated by `ko`), or using `naj la`, `naj-la` (meaning "none of these"), `so la`, `so-la` (meaning "all of these") or `ka la`, `ka-la` (meaning "any of these") followed by `sa`, or saying `ni liw X` (meaning "I want X"), `la sa X`, `na sa X` (meaning "it is" or "they are") or repeating the statement with X only, where X is the choice or choices.

### Examples

**nomi kiwmo pi ti sa?** How many of you are there?  
_kiw sa ponati._ \[There are\] 314.

**Kosapisota tina kiti paw ko-si ta kiwno?** Why did I\* create Picilang?  
_kiw sa ta Kosapisota liw la_ Because I\* wanted to.

**ti sa lo kiwno?** Where are you from?  
_kiw sa lo ma Liwlopa._ \[I am\] from Europe.

**ni pi Mata tajtaj Pokasi ma sa?** Am I from Hungary or Bulgaria?  
_la pi Mata sa._ \[I am\] Hungarian. _ni pi Mata ma sa._ I am from Hungary.

**ti Pokasi tajtaj Mata sa?** Are you Bulgarian or Hungarian?
_la Pokasi sa._ \[You are\] Bulgarian. _ti Pokasi sa._ You are Bulgarian.

\*: Kosapisota is the transliteration of my name.

### Imperative and exclamatory sentences

Imperative (commands and wishes) and exclamatory sentences are structurally the same as declarative sentences, but they end with an exclamation mark.

## naj, lo, ma, so and ka

The words `naj`, `lo`, `ma`, `so` and `ka` are special in that they can be part of any compound word, but they normally cannot be used alone, except when they are used as numbers, or when they are part of a noun phrase and are used as modifiers.

`naj` and `lo` also can be used as regular verbs for answering questions.

## Numbers

Picilang has two separate number systems, one for general everyday use and one to express precise numbers in base 10.

Numbers should precede all the other modifiers in noun phrases.

### Imprecise/general numbers

These are always used as modifiers and can only be used in noun phrases.

The general system consists of 4 words that are `naj`, `lo`, `ki` and `muti` meaning "zero", "one", "many" and "unreasonable amount/number".

To express general numbers as nouns, you can always use `noj` (meaning "unit") or `li` (meaning "thing"), or `la`, if you refer back to a previously mentioned thing.

### Precise numbers

Precise numbers can be used as modifiers in noun phrases (as long as they are integers) or, alternatively, you can form a phrase meaning "X number of units of noun", "Y fractions of noun" or "X number and Y fractions of noun" using the nouns `noj` and `ta` to express units (whole numbers) and fractions respectively, `pi` to express "number of" and `ko` between the units and fractions. This latter form is called _long number expression_.  
If you only need to express a number, you can use `ta` in addition to the nouns listed under _general numbers_.

Even though technically all numbers are compound words consisting multiple modifiers, the actual digits are treated and written as a simple modifier.

To use precise numbers, you can use the words from 0 to 9 and simply read out the number from lowest to highest decimal places (or "right to left"). These numbers are:

| Word | Number |
|------|--------|
| naj  | zero   |
| na   | one    |
| to   | two    |
| ti   | three  |
| po   | four   |
| pa   | five   |
| si   | six    |
| siw  | seven  |
| tij  | eight  |
| no   | nine   |

Negatives are formed by forming a compound modifier ending in `naj` (effectively adding a 0 to the highest decimal place). Negatives can be used on both units and fractions. In both cases they effectively move the number towards the left on the number line.

You can also express fractions (meaning literal fractions, "one third" and alike) by using long number expressions (whose value will be the numerator) and a simple integer as a modifier on the noun (that will be the denominator). Only fractions that has an integer denominator can be said this way, but there is no such restriction for the numerator.

### Examples

- **14**: _pona_
- **-42**: _poto-naj_
- **-3.14**: _ti-naj noj ko pona-naj ta_ (-3 times 1 and -14 times 0.1) or _po-naj noj ko sitiy ta_ (-4 \* 1 + 86 \* 0.1)
- **69.96**: _nosi noj ko sino ta_
- **1995**: _panonona_
- **1/4**: _na noj pi po NO_ (one quarter NOUN)

## Dates and time

Dates (`tati`) and time (`tajmi`) are expressed the same way. You can also refer to date and time collectively as `tatitajmi`.

Date and time are written according to ISO 8601, using the following format (`YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`). One cannot specify timezone, but can express "my time", "your time" (_tajmi pi ni_ and _tajmi pi ti_ respectively) and "UTC" (_mi-tajmi_)
Time can be expressed using a rather long phrase, so try to avoid using it, if possible.

The words for "year (CE)", "year (BCE)", "month", ... and "seconds" are all nouns, connected by `ko`. Fractions of these can also be expressed using long number expressions. For a quick example, the current time (as of writing the first version of this paragraph) is:

_2021-06-05 14:41:20_
tatitajmi pi ni sa natonajto mi-koti ko si kona ko pa napi ko pona lola ko napo pili ko najto siko.

another example would be:

_The time of finishing the this sentence is 15:11. Date's the same._  
tajmi pi pini pi lisa na sa pana lola ko nana pili. tinilo tati sa.

Fractions of times look like this:

_1.5 days_  
na noj ko pa ta pi napi

_2 seconds and 587 milliseconds_  
to noj ko siwtijpa ta pi siko

## Names

Names must be valid words according to previous rules. The name order follows the Eastern name order, meaning that the surname preceded the given name(s).

### Transliterating into Picilang

- Standard rules apply, including the name order.
- Consonant and vowel clusters has to be broken down.
- The syllable count must remain the same.
- When a word begins with a vowel, the transliterated word's first consonant should be used in place of the missing vowel, or the removed consonant, if it had a consonant cluster.
- Transliterated names always begin with a capital letter.
- Initials in names should become a single syllable.
- Use semi-vowels as they feel right, but keep in mind, that they cannot be used as consonants!
  - However, they can be used in place of consonants
- Names and titles can be merged into one word when transliterated and this "work around" some of the restrictions.
- For deciding what letter to you for sounds that aren't present in Picilang, you can use the following _professional_ tables:

![consonants](img/consonants.png)

![vowels](img/vowels.png)

These categories are only a recommendation that makes sense to me, not an official rule.

Examples:

- Internet &gt; _Nitini_
- Github &gt; _Kito_
- B. Zoltan Gorza &gt; _Kosa Pi Sota, Kosapisota_
- névtelen &gt; _Niwtilin_
- Anon &gt; _Nano_
- Mass Effect &gt; _Masipi, Ma Pipi_
- Linux &gt; _Lino_
- Audacity &gt; _Tawtasiti_
