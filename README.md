_Picilang_ /pi.t͡si.läŋɡ/ or _kiti paw ko-si_ /ki.ti aw ko.si/ is a minimalist constructed language designed to be easy to learn and use, although it does not have any restrictions on number of words; the goal is to be easy to use even for beginners with the help of a dictionary (that I plan to create).

## Plans for website

- hosted on github
- based on this markdown
- interactive dictionary
- easy-to-print version (doc + dictionary)

## Features

- SVO word order
- head-final
- compound words are hyphenated
- small alphabet (a, i, o, w, y, k, l, m, n, p, s, t)
- CVs syllables (Consonant, Vowel, optional semi-vowel)
- 5 parts of speech (Noun, Verb, Modifier, Conjunction, Preposition)

## Where to find stuff

- Read the documentation [here](picilang.md),
- Check out the dictionary [here](dictionary.csv),
- Or you can check out the website once it's done.
